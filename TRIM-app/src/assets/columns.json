      "info": "The ZRscore is a projection-based scoring approach, where each data point is projected onto a reference line 2y=x in a normalized x-y coordinate system. The projected point's distance from the origin is used as the score. The method is akin to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) but applied to a single reference line rather than finding orthogonal axes of variance. For each data point, the ZRscore is calculated as follows: Normalize zrank_score to [0,1]. Let (x=R, y=norm(zrank_score)). Compute the projection point (x_p, y_p) on the line 2y=x. Compute t* = (x_i + 2y_i) / 5. Find x_p = t* and y_p = t* / 2. Compute ZRscore_i = sqrt(x_p^2 + y_p^2) or directly use ZRscore_i = (x_i + 2y_i) / sqrt(5). Use ZRscore_i as the final score for ranking."
